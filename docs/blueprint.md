## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#3F704F) to represent growth and knowledge.
- Background color: Very light desaturated green (#F0F4EF). Provides a gentle backdrop.
- Accent color: Burnt orange (#A66321) to provide contrast and draw attention to key interactive elements.
- Body text and headline font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, for a balanced, accessible style.
- Simple human figure icons (silhouettes, not photos) for each student. Use consistent, clear icons for attendance.
- Student names are listed on the left and go down. The dates for the classes run along the top. A separate area below each date/lesson is used to show both the lesson topic and the homework. Include dedicated fields for entering grades.
- Subtle animations for feedback on actions. Example: gentle color change when attendance is recorded or a grade is assigned.
